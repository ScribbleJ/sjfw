ScribbleJ Firmware
(c) 2011 Christopher "ScribbleJ" Jansen

This is a firmware for 3D printers with an advanced gcode pipeline, capable of running at high speeds efficiently.

This firmware includes some portions which are copped directly from the MBI firmware, and some code that is based on
code in the Sprinter and Teacup firmwares.

THIS COMES WITH NO WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, PROMISES, OR CAKE.  I do not recommend that you, or anyone, uses this firmware.
If you do, you do so at your own risk.

I appreciate any bug reports, patches, and amusing stories about how this firmware burned your house down.  You can find
me on Freenode IRC, channel #reprap.  Or email at scribblej@yahoo.com.


SUPPORTED HARDWARE:
Prusa Reprap RAMPS1.2 (experimental!)
Prusa Reprap RAMPS1.3
Thing-O-Matic Gen4

FEATURES(now):
* Control pad and full HOSTLESS printing!
* Advanced Gcode Pipeline
* ISR driven movement
* Acceleration
* LCD Temperature Display
* "Volumteric" Printing
* SD Card support
-- Tested and working with "Pronterface" Reprap host, the best Reprap host there is presently.
-- This repository includes a perl-based "host.pl" which can be used as a host.

FEATURES(planned):
* Advanced movement calculations
* Sanguinololu Support

COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

Examine and edit the top of the Makefile to your satisfaction.  Optionally, look under
rampsXX/config.h or gen4/config.h to change the firmware settings.  You'll probably need to 
change the steps per unit settings, as mine are odd on the Prusa.  ToM users, you should be
fine.

make clean && make && make upload

IMPORTANT NOTES ON USING THIS FIRMWARE:

* The Gen4 Support is perfectly useable on a Reprap, but it is designed for use by the Thing O Matic.  The important
part is this; the Gen4 support ASSUMES you are using the Makerbot Thing-O-Matic EC Firmware on your EC.  If you are
not, you must install that on your EC first!  If you are not using a ToM on Gen4 you will also need to edit the 
steps settings and speeds/accel in the config file to suit.

* The latest release has been tested to work with the EXCELLENT "Pronterface" Host by Kliment:

CURRENTLY KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:

* Config file for ramps13 includes everything; the others may need some love for control panel and lcd support.

* Motors that are set to disable after a move only get disabled a few moves thereafter.  This should work fine, but
don't forget a M84 at the end of your gcode to turn off all motors.

* SD card support works in the firmware, but is not compatible with the Gcodes that Pronterface emits.  This firmware
presently has two Gcodes for SD access:
M204 - fetch filename from SD
M205 - print last fetched filename

* THE SD CODE MAY FAIL ON LONG FILENAMES.  8.3 FILENAMES WORK FINE IN THE MEANTIME.

* THERE IS NO HOMING GCODE.  There probably never will be; it's unnecessary.  Just make a move towards the endstops 
that is longer than the platform, then mark that spot with a G92 and carry on.  Here's some examples:

Here's my start.gcode from my Prusa:
------
M104 S190 (start heating up, but don't wait)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 E0 (set current position)
G1 X-300 Y-300 F2000 (Move to X/Y endstops)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 E0 (set current position)
G1 X5 Y5 (Move away from X/Y endstops)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 E0 (set current position)
G1 X-10 Y-10 F800 (Move back to X/Y endstops)
G1 Z-200 F400 (Move to Z endstop)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 E0 (set current position)
G1 Z5 F400 (Move away from Z endstop)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 E0 (set current position)
G1 Z-10 F400 (Move to Z endstop)
G92 X0 Y0 Z-0.7 E0 (set current position - note endstop is .7 below platform height)
G1 X0 Y0 Z30 F2000 (move to waiting position)
M109 S190 (wait for extruder to reach temperature)
------

Here's the start.gcode from my ToM:
------
M104 S180 (start heating extruder, but don't wait)
M140 S50  (start heating platform, but don't wait)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 E0 (set current position)
G1 Z200 F800 (move to Z endstop)
G1 X-200 Y-200 F2000 (move to X,Y endstops)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 E0 (set current position)
G1 Z-5 X5 Y5 F800 (move away from XYZ endstops)
G92 X0 Y0 Z0 E0 (set current positions)
G1 Z10 X-10 Y-10 F400 (move to XYZ endstops)
G92 X-5 Y-25 Z116.7 E0 (set current positions)
G1 X0 Y0 Z50 F6000 (move to waiting position)
M84 (disable motors)
M109 S180 (wait for extruder to reach temperature)
