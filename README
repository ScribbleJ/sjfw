ScribbleJ Firmware
(c) 2011 Christopher "ScribbleJ" Jansen

This is a firmware for 3D printers with an advance gcode pipeline, capable of running at high speeds efficiently.

This firmware includes some portions which are copped directly from the MBI firmware, and some code that is based on
code in the Sprinter and Teacup firmwares.

THIS COMES WITH NO WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, PROMISES, OR CAKE.  I do not recommend that you, or anyone, uses this firmware.
If you do, you do so at your own risk.


SUPPORTED HARDWARE:
Prusa Reprap RAMPS1.3
Thing-O-Matic Gen4

FEATURES(now):
* Advanced Gcode Pipeline
* ISR driven movement
* Acceleration
* LCD Temperature Display
* "Volumteric" Printing

FEATURES(planned):
* SD Card support
* Control panel
* Advanced movement calculations
* Sanguinololu Support
* Watchdog timer on Temperature control system

COMPILING AND INSTALLING:

Examine and edit the top of the Makefile to your satisfaction.  Optionally, look under
ramps/config.h or gen4/config.h to change the firmware settings.

make clean && make && make upload

IMPORTANT NOTES ON USING THIS FIRMWARE:

* There is no homing Gcode.  Make a move towards the endstops that is longer than the platform, then mark that spot 
with a G92 and carry on.
* This firmware does NOT follow the standard Reprap gcode communication protocol.  It's close enough that if it doesn't
work with your reprap host software (Pronterface, RepSnapper) changing them to understand it will not be difficult, but
I just don't have the time or inclination while I'm busy working on the firmware itself.  Therefore, there is an included 
perl host you may (must?) use.

CURRENTLY KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:

* If you set the firmware to disable a motor after moving, it will miss steps.

* My RAMPS boot/serial connection is somehow flakey and the board resets a few times when I connect.  Therefore, I 
have the host.pl set to look for the 'start' THREE TIMES before it begins sending anything.  You can just click 
the reset button on your motherboard to generate the 'start' message if you need another one to get the print going,
or change the code if you don't have this issue at all.

* Some spurious warnings emitted at compile time due to the way I'm compiling stuff - no worries, but I'll clean it up.
